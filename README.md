# Screen Buttons

The two buttons `Button A` and `Button B` have their `On Click ()` events in the inspector window set to call functions from the `Player` script on the `Player` object.

`Button A` is linked to the function `Jump` and `Button B` is linked to the function `Attack`.

Each of these functions outputs a message in the console to show they have been called.
